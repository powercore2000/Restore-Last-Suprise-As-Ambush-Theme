# Last Suprise Battle Theme

By Powercore2000

This mod only has music files that you can put inside your BGM file to swap the two songs. For that method,
follow Mepharasis's tutorial. For the reloaded II compatible mod, see the google drive link on the mods page:


All music should function correctly when wearing non DLC outfits. This mod should be compatible  with mods that 
modify dlc outfits' music. There might be conflicts with other mods that overwrite the BGM file with another
modified copy.
