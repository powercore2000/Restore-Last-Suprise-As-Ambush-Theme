# Last Suprise Battle Theme

By Powercore2000

Swaps the cue id for the ambush theme to point to Last Suprise (300) and the Battle Theme now points to Takeover (907). This is a code change using signature 
signalling so it should be compatable with other BGM mods, and music swap/replacement like SereC's Phantom Over Royal mod.

It is Unlikley that this mod supports the Gamepass version of the game.
